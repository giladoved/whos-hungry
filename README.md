Who's Hungry iOS App!
=======

This is an app that is meant to streamline the process of getting a group of people together to go out to eat on short notice. When students like you and me only have 1-1.5 hrs to eat, and you don't want to eat alone, texting all of your friends individually, or using group chats can be laborious.

App workflow:

Step 1: Select friends

Step 2: Choose time to meet

Step 3: Vote on the nearest restaurants

Step 4: Confirmation

Step 5: Tracking group members locations as they converge onto the chosen restaurant

Step 6: Chow down

This, removes (entirely) the need for texting to meetup to go get a bite to eat on the fly!
